# ME

In the following screen shot from amazon.com, you can see that in order to get the iPhone 14 Max, you need to work extra 15 to 16 days given the income configuration (see Configuration).

The extension does not differentiate among different figures on the web page. It still needs to be fixed, as many other things:)

### Description
This is an experimental hacked project. A new currency **ME** that helps us to understand our value. A test application that is giving customers a different perspective about values of the goods available online. The extension parses the prices in web pages of the online shops and translates them into the time that we need to spend in work in order to make money to buy the item. You can try to visit e.g. Amazon.de or Zalando.de.

### Installation
The extension works only in Chrome for sure. In or der to use it, you can simply download the archive from github, and add the `me/source` folder into Chrome in the development mode as an extension.

Tap the Save button. Without all fields filled in, the extension does not work.

### Further development and benefits of the application
The extension is in its early development phase and there are many issue, but it is already fun to see the shops from this perspective. For example you can see not only the actual prices but also discounts in the time you have to spend in your work in order to buy it.

The extension can be very useful also in pages offering other products, like insurance, hypothek or loans. That perspective gives another dimension of understanding the offort to consume different products and be careful about accepting the costs.
