### Description
A new currency that helps us to understand our value. A test application that is giving customers a different perspective about values of the goods available online. The extension parses the prices in web pages of the online shops and translates them into the time that we need to spend in work in order to make money to buy the item. You can try to visit e.g. Amazon.de or Zalando.de.

### Configuration
In the settings, fill in the data necessary for the correct functionality of the extension:
- Net income per month (EUR):
- Fixed costs of living per month (EUR):
- Number of working hours per day:
- Number of working hours per month:
- Number of hours spent commuting to work per day:

The extension is in its early development phase, but it is already fun to see the shops from this perspective.
